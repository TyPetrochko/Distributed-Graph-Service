# Distributed-Graph-Service
CS 426 Assignment #1

This group consists of Robert Tung and Tyler Petrochko.

The workload was split such that the graph code was written by one partner (Robert Tung) and the networking code was written by the other partner (Tyler Petrochko). Thus, all code in memorygraph.cpp, memorygraph.hpp and all code to test and compile this portion was written by Robert. All code in main.cpp and the code needed to compile and test the networking code was written by Tyler. After each piece was written and tested, both of us tested the code as a whole before submission.
