# Distributed-Graph-Service
CS 426 Assignment #4

This group consists of Tyler Petrochko and Robert Tung.

The workload was split in the following way:

Tyler added the lock option to the RPC and dealt with the new API changes as well as all of the partition logic with the connection code. Tyler also contributed in large part to modifying the memory graph and the calls to the graph that incorporate partitioning.

Robert also contributed to the modification of the memory graph and the calls to the graph with respect to partitioning.

Both partners tested and debugged the code after implementation.
